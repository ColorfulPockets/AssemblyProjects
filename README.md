# AssemblyProjects
A place to store some of the things I've made with GNU ARM Assembly 

This repository is a collection of class projects made in Assembly.

XOR Encryptor: Reads a file and outputs an encrypted version using bitwise XOR with a user-created key value.

Checksum: Calculates a checksum for a file by reading halfwords from the file and adding them together, then adding a user-created key value.
          It appends this value to the end of the file so that the file can later be read to check if it has been modified.
